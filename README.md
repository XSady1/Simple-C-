Final project for the module

Target:
Strengthen your skills in working with STL library containers and coding skills in the functional programming paradigm.


What should be done:
Write a console application that will act as a translator from English to Morse code. The program must accept a string as input.
The result of the program is the display of text translated into Morse code. Letters in a word are separated by spaces, words in a line are separated by the symbol ''/''.
The program must be able to convert lowercase and uppercase letters of the English alphabet into Morse code
Implement the ability to translate several phrases at a time without the need to restart the program.
The program code must consist of functions that perform a single and specific task.

Result:
The result of the task should be a program code in C++. This code needs to be supplemented with comments so that the purpose of using the main operators is clear. The work is accepted in the form of a file with source code. The file must have one of the following extensions: .doc, .docx, .rtf, .txt, .pdf



Tips and recommendations for completing tasks:
To implement step 4, you can use the while loop. If the user wants to terminate the program, use the break statement or a logical variable.
To implement step 2, you should use the std::map container
